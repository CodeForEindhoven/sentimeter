# Sentimeter Swagger API

Currently focused at targeting the [Waag-App](https://github.com/codeforeindhoven/waag-app-frontend) an anonymous tool to
register sentiment with City Employees without using identities.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This is an example of building a node.js server.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
